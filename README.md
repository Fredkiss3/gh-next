- [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling

## Requirements

- Node >= v18.x
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) >= v8.x
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed for local development
- A registered [github app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) for authenticating users

## üöÄ How to work on the project ?

1. First you have to clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fredkiss3/gh-next.git
   ```

2. **Start the docker compose instance to start the DB + redis instance :**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies :**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` And change the file to your needs,

5. **And launch the project :**

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   The app will show at <http://localhost:3000>.

6. **Open the source code and start rocking ! üòé**
